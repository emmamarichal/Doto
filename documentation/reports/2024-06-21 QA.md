## FontBakery report

fontbakery version: 0.12.7



## Experimental checks

These won't break the CI job for now, but will become effective after some time if nobody raises any concern.

    <div>


> 
> The OpenType 'meta' table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
> just two DataMap records:
> 
> - dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts,
> or languages and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for.
> 
> - slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts,
> or languages and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports.
> 
> 
> The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the
> font overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also
> contains Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports
> Hant, the Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also
> supports the Latn script.
> 
> The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
> but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly "leading" in the design,
> while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
> Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it‚Äôs designed
> for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
> don‚Äôt think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
> 
> The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language
> and script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the
> locl feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in
> dlng explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages
> in meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
> 
> This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the
> slng and dlng structures.
> 
> All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the 'meta' table.
> Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to.
> The Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for
> smarter filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added
> to the Noto fonts.
> 
> In the font making process, some environments store this data in external
> files already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this
> inside the font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools
> may read this data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.
