>This check ensures that all encoded glyphs in the font are covered by a subset declared in the METADATA.pb. Google Fonts splits the font into a set of subset fonts based on the contents of the `subsets` field and the subset definitions in the `glyphsets` repository.
>
>Any encoded glyphs which are not by any of these subset definitions will not be served in the subsetted fonts, and so will be unreachable to the end user.

* ⚠ **WARN** The following codepoints supported by the font are not covered by
    any subsets defined in the font's metadata file, and will never
    be served. You can solve this by either manually adding additional
    subset declarations to METADATA.pb, or by editing the glyphset
    definitions.

>
>Most variable fonts should include an avar table to correctly define axes progression rates.
>
>For example, a weight axis from 0% to 100% doesn't map directly to 100 to 1000, because a 10% progression from 0% may be too much to define the 200, while 90% may be too little to define the 900.
>
>If the progression rates of axes is linear, this check can be ignored. Fontmake will also skip adding an avar table if the progression rates are linear. However, we still recommend designers visually proof each instance is at the expected weight, width etc.

(<a href="https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags">com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags</a>)</summary><div>

>
>The OpenType 'meta' table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with just two DataMap records:
>
>- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for.
>
>- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports.
>
>The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn script.
>
>The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs, but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly "leading" in the design, while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
>
>The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
>
>This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng structures.
>
>All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the 'meta' table. Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
>
>In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.

>
>There are various metadata in the OpenType spec to specify if a font is monospaced or not. If the font is not truly monospaced, then no monospaced metadata should be set (as sometimes they mistakenly are...)
>
>Requirements for monospace fonts:
>
>* post.isFixedPitch - "Set to 0 if the font is proportionally spaced, non-zero if the font is not proportionally spaced (monospaced)" (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm)
>
>* hhea.advanceWidthMax must be correct, meaning no glyph's width value is greater. (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm)
>
>* OS/2.panose.bProportion must be set to 9 (monospace) on latin text fonts.
>
>* OS/2.panose.bSpacing must be set to 3 (monospace) on latin hand written or latin symbol fonts.
>
>* Spec says: "The PANOSE definition contains ten digits each of which currently describes up to sixteen variations. Windows uses bFamilyType, bSerifStyle and bProportion in the font mapper to determine family type. It also uses bProportion to determine if the font is monospaced." (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#pan https://monotypecom-test.monotype.de/services/pan2)
>
>* OS/2.xAvgCharWidth must be set accurately. "OS/2.xAvgCharWidth is used when rendering monospaced fonts, at least by Windows GDI" (http://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/15397/#Comment_15397)
>
>Also we should report an error for glyphs not of average width.
>
>Please also note:
>
>Thomas Phinney told us that a few years ago (as of December 2019), if you gave a font a monospace flag in Panose, Microsoft Word would ignore the actual advance widths and treat it as monospaced.
