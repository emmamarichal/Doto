## About

Doto is a bit-map inspired, open-source, variable, monospace and geometric typeface family, designed for display purposes.

Each glyph is built using a 6x10 reference matrix, and the typeface supports two variable axes: one controlling the size of the dots and another controlling the roundness of the dots.
